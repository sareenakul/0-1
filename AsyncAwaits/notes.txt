Javascript is a single threaded language.
But time can be saved by Asyncronous functions :
    - Delegating
    - Context Switching

* Can also perform syncSleep that runs a meaningless loop to pass time.


Other Async functions:-
    fs.readFile
    Fetch

along with call stack and callback queue. 

### Promises: Syntactical sugar or a pretty way to write call back functions.

# Should have no arguments or callbacks in there.
